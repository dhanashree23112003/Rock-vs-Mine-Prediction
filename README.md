House vs Mine Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify whether an object is a house or a mine based on its sonar signal returns. The model utilizes various classification algorithms to perform this task. The dataset used is the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

60 attributes: Each represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. These attributes are numbered from X1 to X60.
Class label: 'R' if the object is a rock (mine) and 'M' if it is a metal cylinder (house).
Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
